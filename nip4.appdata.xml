  <p>
	  nip2 is a GUI for the VIPS scientific image processing library. 
	  It's a little 
	  like a spreadsheet: you create a set of formula connecting your 
	  images together, and on a change nip2 recalculates. 
  </p>
  <p>
 	  It can load 
	  images in most commonly used formats, but also in scientific 
	  formats such as Matlab, FITS, OpenSlide, OpenEXR, and others. 
	  nip2 is especially useful with very large images.  You can 
	  easily work with multi-gigabyte images even on a modest computer.
